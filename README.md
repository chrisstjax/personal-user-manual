## How to Contact Me


<details>
    <summary>Tips</summary>
    1. You can always reach me on Slack for anything quick
    2. If you want to connect, an impromptu Slack huddle or Zoom meeting works well
    3. For anything that needs a larger conversation, grab some time on my calendar. I do my best to keep it up to date

## Preferred Working Style


<details>
    <summary>Stjax Style</summary>
    - I see my team as a "team" - sports analogies will be used
    - I think like an engineer but have evolved into a product manager over time
    - When my coworkers look to me for help/support I prefer they lead with the problem not the potential solutions. Working out solutions is what I do best!
    - I love to talk through ideas out loud
    - Big on company culture
    - I believe my superpower is being able to communicate comfortably with engineers and business stakeholders
</details>

## Weaknesses I'm Conscious Of


<details>
    <summary>I'm working on it</summary>
    - I can get distracted by problems that are not urgent - they can't be that hard to fix right?!
    - I have strong feelings about engineering practices/principles that can leak out even now that I am no longer an engineer

## My Pet Peeves


<details>
    <summary>Don't take offense - it's probably not about you</summary>
    - People who describe me in the "& team" bucket. Saying "manager name and team worked really hard on _____" is not good enough. Unless the team is > 5 people, use names.

    <summary>Tips</summary>
Optional Section: There are some sections that are deliberately omitted from this template, but which arguably should be here - depending on your role, how comfortable you are sharing with your team etc. You may want to include these or use them as inspiration for your own.

- "How I like my 1:1s" - This might be more relevant for managers to set expectations of their direct reports. Although direct reports certainly should have a say in how their 1:1s are structured
- "Quirks" - While this is a fun one, there is a temptation to hide behaviour here that probably should be worked on instead. Additionally, behaviour is complex, situation dependent and evolving. Stating you have a particular quirk makes it immutable and sets the expectation that you will always act like this. That said please feel free to include a section like this as it's a good icebreaker, and adds a personal touch. Just be aware that you might be unaware of some of your own "quirky" behaviour.
- "How to interpret my calendar" - If you're someone with wall to wall meetings every day it might be difficult for colleagues to find a good time to speak with you. If this is the case, then this section might be helpful to outline when you typically could make time for them.
- "What you can expect from me" - Another one that might be useful for line managers, career coaches and mentors more than ICs. You may want to use this to set expectations around how often you'll be scheduling catchups, how you share feedback and what sort of support you can offer.
